CharacterEditor
===============

A character editor I built for 2D games. It supports project and character .xml files creation and also animations with framesheets. Currently put on ice due to lack of time.

ModernUiUpdate: The source code for the application, written in .Net, WPF and a modern UI framework, designed with a persistent MvVM architecture.
XmlToBin: Reads the project and character .xml files and creates binary data for use in games. In real UTF-8 (I think).
CharacterModelLib: Model classes used by the appliation and the converter.
